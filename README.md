## Stonks
A program that alerts and sends a profile of a stock that meets qualifying factors:
The alert and profile will include, the symbol of the stock, current bar count and resistance levels. This is currently in text form with the idea of a graph representation to be added.

### TODO
- Create filter to only include stocks that are close to resistance levels, (removing ones that are to far off from triggering a buy signal). 
- Report (how to send?) currently only being uploaded in text file here.
- Include chart profile of stock in alert, with bar count and resistance levels.

### Things being considered
price-data.py 
- Fetch data for tickers as a group.

main.py
- Change the name!
- Should I flip the table data so the latest close is first in the index of data?
- Clean up
